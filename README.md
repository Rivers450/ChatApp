# ChatApp
In this personal project that I made, I used TypeScript and React to make a chat app, for the information to be stored I used: a website called Chat Engine
This is the Chat Engine link if you want to check the website out: https://chatengine.io/
# Instructions to run:
1. You will need to download the Zip file and Extract it, then open the folder in your favorite IDE
2. In the terminal type in: npm install, this will install the needed packages to run this app
3. After all the packages are installed, in the terminal type in: npm run start, this will start the server (by default it will be localhost:3000)
4. If it server does not automatically run in a browser, then you will need to open a browser and in the URL type in: localhost:3000
